# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Add a guarded `Experimental Three workbench` setting for direct GLB/GLTF file-view workbench surfaces.
- Keep production workbench routing conservative by default, and automatically fall back to Babylon.js if the experimental Three workbench load fails.
- Limit experimental workbench Three routing to direct GLB/GLTF resources; converted assets and non-GLTF formats remain on Babylon.js.
- Add a direct file-view workbench panel with backend/route status, model metrics, explode controls, and knowledge-note actions.
- Expand verification with real Obsidian file-view workbench coverage for Three backend selection, focus/disassembly controls, panel explode, annotation mode, knowledge-note generation, and conversion-chain error feedback.

## 0.2.5

- Add a Three.js frame budget that lowers interactive pixel ratio, reduces annotation observer refreshes, and defers shadow refreshes when rotate/zoom frames get expensive.
- Pause Three.js rendering when previews leave the viewport, then resume with a dirty frame and refreshed shadows when they return.
- Add Three.js disposal audit counters for model switches and teardown so geometry, material, and texture cleanup is visible in performance snapshots.
- Classify loaded models by performance tier and show large-model feedback with triangle/splat and material counts.
- Add early 0.2.6 annotation foundations: label overlap avoidance and near-pin visual priority while rotating.

## 0.2.4

- Add `npm run verify:obsidian` for an end-to-end Obsidian smoke test that installs the plugin into a test vault, opens a verification note, and checks that GLB/STL WebGL canvases render non-empty pixels.
- Add `npm run verify:release` to validate manifest/package/versions consistency and print release asset sizes plus SHA-256 hashes.
- Update the release workflow to run asset verification and publish release notes with asset hashes.
- Document release-token hygiene so publishing does not rely on long-lived or over-scoped personal access tokens.

## 0.2.3

- Improve Three.js preview performance while zooming and rotating models with an interactive pixel-ratio cap, finite idle observer settling, and more conservative shadow-map updates.
- Refresh annotation occlusion in small batches while the camera moves, reducing delayed bookmark visibility changes on tagged models.
- Align focus-mode behavior between Three.js and the main engine path, including blank-click handling and dim material behavior.
- Add hidden workbench verification coverage for the Three.js capability probe while keeping production workbench routing on Babylon.js.
- Expand preview verification with workbench fallback, direct STL/PLY/OBJ routing, performance snapshots, moving-pin occlusion checks, and browser auto-detection.
- Verify the packaged plugin in Obsidian 1.12.7 with real GLB/STL code blocks, loaded plugin state, helper toolbars, and non-empty WebGL canvases.
